This function is the main code for portfolio optimization in a non-zero transaction cost environment based on the linearized augmented Lagrangian method. Based on some empirical financial principles and optimization strategies, it uses elastic-net regularization terms to consider the correlation between transaction costs and variables, thereby maximizing the cumulative wealth in the entire investment while reducing transaction costs.

For the usage of this function, you can refer to the following papers:
